JavaScript library for `Firefox Marketplace`_ payments.

This is a helper library for web apps to accept in-app payments on
`Firefox OS`_.
The `in-app payments guide`_ provides a deep dive into the underlying APIs and
concepts.

There isn't much to see yet.
This is a work in progress that aims to simplify what an app has to
do to accept payments. We're calling this "server-less in-app payments"
because when fully functional this library will let you do payments without
hosting your own server.
